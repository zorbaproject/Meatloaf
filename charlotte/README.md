The name reflects its core feature: it's a topographic tool for caves, like the famous DistoX, but it's hacky and cheap because it is built with a RaspberryPi computer and hobby electronics components. It's also rapid and lossless, because every parameter is automatically recorded without the need for manual intervention, and works offline without the need for any bluetooth, wifi, or other kind of connection. Finally it's all embedded in a single box, making it robust and easy to use in caves.

The logo is inspired by the Charlotte cake:

Its classic cilindrical shape reflects the shape of the prototipe of this device. Also, there's a joke because this device is built on a Raspberry Pi, which sounds similar to "raspberry pie", and the Charlotte is a cake you can make also with wild berries (like raspberries).
